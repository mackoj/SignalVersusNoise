# SignalVersusNoise

When building an app using a TCA it can be hard to grasp everything that is happening this app want to help you understand what is happening.

This project is a TCA Debugger app.

The goal of the TCADebugger was to make visible these patterns of calls in a TCA app, understand quickly what was happening, and help newcomers to understand what was happening. It worked by connecting through bonjour. The app that is observed sends information about itself and the TCADebugger(the server) received and displays the data.

This is not actively maintained.
